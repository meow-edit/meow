Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs.

It aims to blend modal editing into Emacs with minimum interface with its original key-bindings, avoiding most if not all the hassle introduced by key-binding conflicts. This leads to less needed configuration and better integration. With fewer commands to remember, more is achieved.

Some key features compared to existing solutions.

- Minimal configuration to build your own modal editing
- Lightweight with minimal dependency (only depend on =dash.el= and =s.el=)
- Minimal number of keys occupied
  - Much easier to remember for people trying modal editing
  - More keys available for your own key-bindings
  - Most of the time, you do not even need to hold shift!
- Lightning fast (unlike Evil)
- Minimize modifier usage (e.g. =SPC x f= for =C-x C-f=) inspired by god mode
- Better workflow for kmacro application at multiple places
- Interactive selection manipulation inspired by avy
- Selection as top-tier object, and keybindings built around selection
- Compatible with vanilla Emacs keymap (or any other keymap in any packages)
- Effortless uniform keymaps across modes
- Key-binding conflicts handling made easy
