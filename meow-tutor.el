==================================================================

 Meow is yet another modal editing mode for Emacs.
 What's modal editing? How to use Meow? Let's start our journey!

 If you wonder what a keystroke means when reading this, just ask
 Emacs! Press C-h k then press the key you want to query.

==================================================================
=                     BASIC CURSOR MOVEMENT                      =
==================================================================

  To move up, press \\[meow-prev]
  To move down, press \\[meow-next]
  To move left, press \\[meow-left]
  To move right, press \\[meow-right]
       ↑
       \\[meow-prev]
   ← \\[meow-left]   \\[meow-right] →
       \\[meow-next]
       ↓

 You can move the cursor using the \\[meow-left], \\[meow-next], \\[meow-prev], \\[meow-right] keys, as shown
 above. Arrow keys also work, but it is faster
 to use the \\[meow-left]\\[meow-next]\\[meow-prev]\\[meow-right] keys as they are closer to the other keys you
 will be using. Try moving around to get a feel for \\[meow-left]\\[meow-next]\\[meow-prev]\\[meow-right].
 Once you're ready, hold \\[meow-next] to continue to the next lesson.

 Meow provides modal editing which means you have different
 modes for inserting and editing text. The primary modes you will
 use are Normal mode and Insert mode. While in Normal mode, the
 keys you press won't actually type text. Instead, they will
 perform various actions with the text. This allows for more
 efficient editing. This tutor will teach you how you can make
 use of Meow's modal editing features. To begin, ensure your
 caps-lock key is not pressed and hold the \\[meow-next] key until you reach
 the first lesson.


=================================================================
=                           DELETION                            =
=================================================================

 Press the \\[meow-delete] key to delete the character under the cursor.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Move the cursor to each extra character, and press d to
    delete it.

 --> Thhiss senttencee haass exxtra charracterss.
     This sentence has extra characters.

 Once the sentence is correct, move on to the next lesson.

=================================================================
=                          INSERT MODE                          =
=================================================================

 Press the \\[meow-insert] key to enter Insert mode.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Move to a place in the line which is missing text and press
    i to enter Insert mode. Keys you press will now type text.
 3. Enter the missing text.
 4. Press <ESC> to exit Insert mode and return to Normal mode.
 5. Repeat until the line matches the line below it.

 --> Th stce misg so.
     This sentence is missing some text.

 Note: If you want to move the cursor while in Insert mode,
       you may use the arrow keys instead of exiting and
       re-entering Insert mode.
 Note: The modeline will display your current mode.
       Notice that when you press \\[meow-insert], '[N]' changes to '[I]'.

=================================================================
=                      MORE ON INSERT MODE                      =
=================================================================

 Pressing \\[meow-insert] is not the only way to enter Insert Mode. Below are
 listed some other ways to enter Insert mode at different locations.

 Common examples of insertion commands include:
   \\[meow-insert] - Insert before the selection.
   \\[meow-append] - Insert after the selection. (a stands for 'append')
   \\[meow-join] \\[meow-append] - Insert at the start of the line.
   \\[meow-line] \\[meow-append] - Insert at the end of the line.
   \\[meow-open-above] - Insert above the current line (this will create a new
       line above the current one)
   \\[meow-open-below] - Insert below the current line (this will create a new
       line below the current one)

 The commands of Meow are composable! \\[meow-join] will select the begining
 of the current line and the end of the non-empty line above.
 \\[meow-append] switches to Insert mode at the end of current selection.
 Using both commands together will result in cursor position at
 the beginning of the line (in Insert mode). \\[meow-line] selects the
 whole line and enables the use of the same insertion commands.

 1. Move to anywhere in the line below marked -->.
 2. Press \\[meow-line] \\[meow-append], your cursor will move to the end of
    the line and you will be able to type.
 3. Type the text necessary to match the line below.
 4. Press \\[meow-join] \\[meow-append], your cursor will move to the beginning
    of the line. This will place the cursor before -->. For now
    just use the arrow keys to navigate after it. We will learn
	commands to move forword faster later.

 -->  sentence is miss
     This sentence is missing some text.

=================================================================
=                             RECAP                             =
=================================================================

 + Use the \\[meow-left],\\[meow-next],\\[meow-prev],\\[meow-right] keys to move the cursor.

 + Press \\[meow-delete] to delete the character at the cursor.

 + Press \\[meow-join] to select the start of the current line and
   the non-empty line above.

 + Press \\[meow-insert] to enter Insert mode and type text. Press <ESC> to
   return to Normal mode.

=================================================================
=                    MOTIONS AND SELECTIONS                     =
=================================================================

 Pressing \\[meow-next-word] will select everything from the cursor
 position until the end of the current word. Numbers that show up
 on the screen indicate a quick way to extend your selection. 

 Pressing \\[meow-kill] will delete the current selection.

 The \\[meow-delete] key deletes the character at the cursor, while
 \\[meow-kill] deletes all of the selected text.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Move to the beginning of a word that needs to be deleted.
 3. Press \\[meow-next-word] to select additional word.
 4. Press \\[meow-kill] to delete the selection.
 5. Repeat for all extra words in the line.

 --> This sentence pencil has vacuum extra words in the it.
     This sentence has vacuum words in it.

=================================================================
=                        MORE ON MOTIONS                        =
=================================================================

 Using \\[meow-next-word] is not only useful for selection, but also
 serves as a fast way to move around the text. Below are listed some
 other useful motions.

 Some common motions include:
   \\[meow-next-word] - Moves the cursor forward to the end of the current word.
   \\[meow-back-word] - Moves the cursor backward to the beginning of the current word.
   \\[meow-next-symbol] - Moves the cursor to the end of the current symbol.
   \\[meow-back-symbol] - Moves the cursor to the start of the current symbol.

 Symbols are like words, but they are only separated by whitespace,
 whereas words can be separated by other characters in addition to
 whitespace.

 To understand the difference better do the follow exercise:
 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Use \\[meow-next-word] and \\[meow-next-symbol] to traverse over the sentence.

 --> This sentence is made of words and the-symbols.

=================================================================
=                      THE CHANGE COMMAND                       =
=================================================================

 Pressing \\[meow-change] will delete the current selection and switch
 to Insert mode. If there is no selection it will change only the
 character under the cursor. It is a shorthand for \\[meow-delete]\\[meow-insert].

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Move to the start of an incorrect word and press \\[meow-next-word] to
    select it.
 3. Press \\[meow-change] to delete the word and enter Insert mode.
 4. Type the correct word.
 5. Repeat until the line matches the line below it.

 --> This paper has heavy words behind it.
     This sentence has incorrect words in it.

=================================================================
=                        SELECTING LINES                        =
=================================================================

 Pressing \\[meow-line] will select the whole line. Pressing it again
 will add the next line to the selection .

 1. Move the cursor to the second line below marked -->.
 2. Press \\[meow-line] to select the line, and \\[meow-kill] to delete it.
 3. Move to the fourth line.
 4. Press \\[meow-line] twice or type \\[meow-line]2 to select 2 lines, and \\[meow-kill] to delete.

 --> 1) Roses are red,
 --> 2) Mud is fun,
 --> 3) Violets are blue,
 --> 4) I have a car,
 --> 5) Clocks tell time,
 --> 6) Sugar is sweet,
 --> 7) And so are you.

=================================================================
=                      MOTIONS WITH EXPAND                      =
=================================================================

 Expanding the selected region is easy. In fact every motion
 command has its own expand type. Motions can be expanded in
 different directions and units.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Type \\[meow-line] to select an additional line. 
 3. Type 2 to expand the selection forward by 2 line.
 4. Try the above with different numbers.

 --> 1) Roses are red,
 --> 2) Mud is fun,
 --> 3) Violets are blue,
 --> 4) I have a car,
 --> 5) Clocks tell time,
 --> 6) Sugar is sweet,
 --> 7) And so are you.
 --> 8) Do you like meow?

=================================================================
=                         MORE ON EXPAND                        =
=================================================================

 In fact, every motion command has its own selection type, indicating
 whether we could expand its selection region and if we could, what the
 unit (character, word, line...) we use to expand it.

 \\[meow-line] have selection type \"expand, line\"
 \\[meow-next-word] has selection type \"no-expand word\"
 \\[meow-mark-word] has selection type \"expand, word\"

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Type \\[meow-line] to select one line forward.
 3. Type 2 to expand the selection forward by 2 line.
 4. Type 2 to move 2 words backwards
 5. Try the above with different numbers.

 --> 1) Roses are red,
 --> 2) Mud is fun,
 --> 3) Violets are blue,
 --> 4) I have a car,
 --> 5) Clocks tell time,
 --> 6) Sugar is sweet,
 --> 7) And so are you.

=================================================================
=                         SAVE AND YANK                         =
=================================================================

 Pressing \\[meow-save] copies the selection, which can be then pasted
 with \\[meow-yank] under the cursor.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Type \\[meow-line] to select one line forward.
 3. Type \\[meow-save] to copy the current selection. The cursor
    will enter next position (based your current selection type).
 4. Type \\[meow-yank] to paste the copied content.
 5. You can paste as many times as you want.

 --> Violets are blue, and I love you.

=================================================================
=                         KILL ANK YANK                         =
=================================================================

 The \\[meow-kill] also copies the deleted content which can be then
 pasted with \\[meow-yank].

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Type \\[meow-line] to select one line forward.
 3. Type \\[meow-kill] to cut the current selection. The cursor
    will jump to the first position of your current selection.

 The select command selects regular expressions, not just exact
 matches, allowing you to target more complex patterns.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.
 2. Select the line with x and then press s.
 3. Enter   + to select any amount of consecutive spaces >1.
 4. Press c and change the matches to single spaces.

 --> This  sentence has   some      extra spaces.

 Note: If you want to perform find-and-replace, the select
       command is the way to do it. Select the text you want
       to replace in — type  to select the whole file — and
       then perform the steps explained above.

=================================================================
FIXME rewrite

 Type ; to collapse selections to single cursors.

 Sometimes, you want to deselect without having to move the
 cursor(s). This can be done using the ; key.

 1. Move the cursor to the line below marked -->.

 2. Use the motions you have learned to move around the line,
    and try using ; to deselect the text after it is selected
    by the motions.
