#+title: Vim Comparison

* Intro

Despite being another modal editing scheme, meow is not very similar
to [[https://www.vim.org/][Vim]], but instead tends to be more like [[https://kakoune.org/][kakoune]].

The primary difference to Vim are that there is no dedicated visual mode
in meow, since it's essentially built into normal mode. Almost every
movement in normal mode creates a visual selection on which some
command can act on.

The other main difference is that the language grammar you use in Vim is
flipped in meow.

In Vim, you might use something like =4w= to move 4 words forward. =4=
acts as a quantifier, and =w= is the so called "verb." In meow, we think
about commands the opposite way. We'd first select a single word, with
=meow-next-word= (which, critically, both moves the point *and* creates a
selection), and /then/ press =3= to select three more words. This process
can be indefinitely extended. For example, if you say 2 and 6
afterwards you select another 8 words forward.

Once you have a selection, you can decide to execute an action
("verb") representing what you want to do on this selection.

In vim, to change (delete and enter insert mode) 3 words, you might
press =c3w=. In meow, this would be =e3c= since the grammar is inverted.

Meow has the clear advantage that when you create the selection, you
get visual feedback on what your target selection is, and then can
decide which verb to execute. You can choose to abort if you selected
something wrong, or better, revert your selection to make a new
one. In Vim on the other hand, you commit on the verb right away, then
guess at your selection target (which is harder the more things you want
to act on). If you mess up, you have no choice but to undo everything
and try again.

Since many people who want to give meow a try, come from a Vim / Evil
background, here is an overview of typical Vim keybindings for common
actions and how they can be achieved in meow.

Please note that we provide only command names here, this is because
meow has no built-in keybind set (yet?). If you decide to use the
suggested [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow/blob/master/KEYBINDING_QWERTY.org][QWERTY]] keybindings, you can look up the default binding to
each command there.

* Macros

Vim uses registers to store macros. Meow only has a key to start a macro and afterwards play it. When a new macro is recorded the old one will be overridden.
The reason is that meow just wraps the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyboardMacros][default Emacs Macro]] behavior.

If you want to store more than macro you can store the last recorded macro under a name with the ~kmacro-name-last-macro~ command. You can afterwards execute that command from the ~M-x~ menu.

* Adjectives

Except for some cases, namely =meow-word=, =meow-line= and =meow-block=,
meow generalizes the idea of selection in and around "things". You may
select inside any "thing" by first calling =meow-inner-of-thing= and
then following the onscreen prompts. Meow makes it easy to define your
own "things" as well, all it takes is a pair of regular expressions!

| Vim          | Meow                            | Description             |
|--------------+---------------------------------+-------------------------|
| <action> iw  | ~meow-mark-word~ <action>       | current word            |
| <action> iW  | ~meow-mark-symbol~ <action>     | current symbol          |
| <action> i[  | ~meow-inner-of-thing~ <action>  | inside square brackets) |
| <action> ci[ | ~meow-bounds-of-thing~ <action> | around square brackets) |

* Command Mode Operations
Generally there is no mode in meow similar to command mode. But there
is Keypad Mode (entered with space) which let's you execute normal
emacs commands without holding modifier keys. Many things done in
command mode can be achieved via this mode and some common and useful
examples are given here.

| Vim | Meow                 | Description          |
|-----+----------------------+----------------------|
| :w  | SPC x s              | (save buffer)        |
| :qa | SPC m x "kill-emacs" | close vim / emacs    |
| :wq | SPC x c              | save and close emacs |
