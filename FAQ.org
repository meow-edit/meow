#+title: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

* Why do meow-append and meow-insert behave the same way when there is no region?

In Emacs cursor is located between two characters, so we would have to implement a hack to have same behaviour. You can read more about it in [[https://github.com/meow-edit/meow/discussions/87][this discussion thread]].

* Why does my keybind execute a command from another package instead of Meow's?

Meow's internal command will not call emacs' commands directly. They will call a keybind which is then linked to a command. A package you have installed might be overriding the functionality of the specific keybind. Lookup the command you want to execute ([[meow-var.el][meow-var.el]]) and overwrite it in your config.

** Example

Here you can map Delete character to internal Meow's delete character function.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq meow--kbd-delete-char "<deletechar>")
#+end_src
