DESCRIPTION. Following these two arguments, pairs of keywords and
values should be passed, similarly to define-minor-mode syntax.

Recognized keywords:
:keymap - the keymap to use for the state
:lighter - the text to display in the mode line while state is active
:face - custom cursor face

The last argument is an optional lisp form that will be run when the minor
mode turns on AND off. If you want to hook into only the turn-on event,
check whether (meow-NAME-SYM-mode) is true.

Example usage:
(meow-define-state mystate
  \"My meow state\"
  :lighter \" [M]\"
  :keymap 'my-keymap
  (message \"toggled state\"))

Also see meow-register-state, which is used internally by this
function, if you want more control over defining your state. This
is more helpful if you already have a keymap and defined minor
mode that you only need to integrate with meow.

This function produces several items:
1. meow-NAME-mode: a minor mode for the state. This is the main entry point.
2. meow-NAME-mode-p: a predicate for whether the state is active.
3. meow-cursor-type-NAME: a variable for the cursor type for the state.
4. meow--update-cursor-NAME: a function that sets the cursor type to 3.
 and face FACE or 'meow-unknown cursor if FACE is nil."
